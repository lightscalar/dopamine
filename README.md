# Trust Region Policy Optimization

This is a Tensorflow-based implementation of [Trust Region Policy
Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05477), a deep reinforcement learning
technique. This code has been tested on Python 3.5+.

This implementation is intended to be more pedagogical than optimal. We focus
here on understanding the algorithm via clear code. That said, when run on a
GPU, it performs just fine on small-scale problems.

## Tests

Tests can be executed using [nose](http://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Just
run it from the ```tests/``` directory.
